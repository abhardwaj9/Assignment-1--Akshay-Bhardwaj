				<p id="L5">Patented Technology</p>
				<p id="L8">Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit <b>strong neural phase locking</b> â€” 
				   allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity - and technology to remove distraction in sound.</p>
				<p>This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into brain into a desired mental state. In other words, we have found new ways to create music that
				   helps you do what you need to do.</p>

				<p id="L6">Tested on Brain and Behaviour</p>
				<p>Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments</p>
				<p>We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and
				   also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.</p>
				<p><b>Our experiments always include a control condition ('placebo')</b> of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our
				   tech is what makes the diferrence.</p>
